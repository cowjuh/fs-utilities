### PNG to Excel Converter (`scripts/png_to_excel_user_friendly`)

A Python script that converts all PNG images in a selected folder into an organized Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet includes thumbnails and detailed metadata for each image (filename, dimensions in pixels and inches, color mode, and format). The script is easy to use, automatically installs dependencies, and saves the results in a new folder next to your images.
